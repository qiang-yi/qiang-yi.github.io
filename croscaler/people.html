					<p>Dr. Yi Qiang is an assistant professor at the Department of Geography and Environment, University of Hawaii – Manoa. Dr. Qiang obtained his Ph.D. from Ghent University at Belgium in 2012 and worked as research associates at Louisiana State University and University of Colorado - Boulder. His research focuses on spatio-temporal data modeling, geovisualization, disaster risk, resilience, and CNH systems. Dr. Qiang is interested in developing innovative data models, analytical frameworks and software tools to derive useful information and knowledge from diverse forms of geospatial data. </p>

					<p>Babs research interests focus on cartographic generalization, impacts of scale and resolution on geographic data and models, graphic and database representations of uncertainty, and on visualization tools for geographic modeling. She is Director of the Meridian Lab, a research facility dedicated to visualization and modeling geographic information and technology, specifically in the areas of environmental modeling. Recently completed projects include work with USGS to develop intermediate scale versions of the National Hydrography dataset, and an NSF-funded project to integrate U.S. Census microdata with summary files. Current projects in addition to CroScaler include developing new metrics for distance, area and volume measurement on digital terrain models that take into account elevation, slope, and curvature (i.e., surface-adjusted). Ongoing work with USGS uses machine learning to classify landscape types to tailor data modeling algorithms to varying conditions of terrain roughness, settlement patterns, and climate.</p>

					<p>Dr. Nodari Sitchinava is an associate professor at the Department of Information and Computer Science, University of Hawaii at Manoa. He received his Ph.D. from University of California, Irvine in 2009. His research focuses on designing efficient algorithms and data structures that are both parallel (can be run using multiple processors) and I/O-efficient (utilize faster local memory, e.g. caches, efficiently).</p>

					<img src="images/headshots/george.jpg" alt="George" align="left"><br><br><h2>Georgios (George) Charisoulis</h2><br><h3>Ph.D. student of Geography at University of Colorado – Boulder</h3>
					<p>George Charisoulis is currently a PhD candidate in the Department of Geography at the University of Colorado at Boulder, with research specialization in GIScience. His research focuses on the impact that missing data and distance uncertainties introduce in location allocation modeling, further asking the questions, how can these uncertainties be measured? Is there a way to filter space for location-allocation models and make a logical conclusion even when lacking data? Working with advisor Dr. Barbara Buttenfield, he is exploring the degree to which modeling (scripting) coupled with the use of machine learning can be used to investigate good candidate locations that fit threshold criteria for siting Anaerobic Digesters. His education background in sustainability through a master’s degree in Denmark at Aalborg University, has helped to conceptually and theoretically understand the constrains that come with renewable energy and international policies that need to be examined.  </p>
